                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>
                        This lesson will cover the inner workings of a blockchain, discussing what a typical blockchain consists of and how it works.

                    </p>
                    <h3>Learning outcomes</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To discover what a typical blockchain is made up of.</li>
                        <li>To understand how a blockchain works.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>What are consensus algorithms?</h3>
                    <p>A consensus protocol is simply a mechanism that allows all nodes in the  blockchain network to reach a common agreement about the current state of the blockchain.  They ensure that every new block that is added to the blockchain is a undisputed version of the truth agreed upon by all participants of the blockchain. </p>

                    <h3>Why are they important?</h3>
                    <p>As mentioned before, blockchains are decentralized in nature meaning that there is no central authority present to verify and validate transactions. Nonetheless, every transaction in the blockchain is secured, and verified. This is only made possible through the presence of consensus protocols. They supply blockchains with reliability and provide trust between unknown nodes in a decentralized environment.</p>

                    <h3>How they work?</h3>
                    <p> There are many implementations of consensus protocols across multiple different blockchains, therefore this section will supply you with the working examples of consensus algorithms and how they work.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Proof of Work</h4>
                    <p>Proof of work is perhaps the most notable consensus algorithm as it is utilized by the bitcoin blockchain. The concept behind this protocol is to select a miner ( node) for the next block generation. Proof of work requires the participants of the network to devote a significant amount of computational power to solve a complex mathematical puzzle based on a leading number of zeros. On success, it results in a new block being added to the block chain and the winning miner is rewarded with bitcoin.</p>
                    <p>The video below provides a greater in-depth explanation of proof of work, so be sure to watch it!</p>

                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <h4>Proof of stake</h4>
                    <p>
                        Proof of stake was created as more sustainable, energy efficient alternative to proof of work. It relies on validators to secure the network. With proof of stake instead of the participants devoting computational power, they devote their tokens as collateral ( staking) with the hopes of being selected as a validator. 
                        When a block of transactions is ready to be processed, the proof of stake protocol will randomly select a node to be a validator based on factors such as staking age ( the duration of time the participant has staked for) and the monetary value of the amount staked. 
                        The chosen validator checks if the transactions in the block are accurate. If so they add the block to the blockchain and receive crypto rewards for their contribution. However, if a validator attempts to add a block with inaccurate information, they will lose some of the staked holdings as a punishment.
                        Proof of stake has gained a vast amount of popularity since the Ethereum blockchain switched from Proof of work, to proof of stake.
