                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>
                        Welcome to the first lesson of foundations of Blockchain. This course aims teach the areas of blockchain to everyone regardless of their background. There will be a variety of sources and videos all maintained in a central place as we recognize that people  learn in different ways.  In this lesson you will introduced briefly as to what blockchain is and why it is used.

                    </p>
                    <h3>Learning outcomes</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Get a basic understanding of the concept of blockchain</li>
                        <li>To discover when it was originated.</li>
                        <li>To understand why blockchain technology is used.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>What is blockchain?</h3>
                    <p>To put it simply, a blockchain is a special type of database. A blockchain differs from traditional databases in the way that data is stored. As the name suggests, A blockchain collects information together in groups which can also be referred to as “blocks” and these blocks are linked to other stored blocks that help form a “chain” of data known as a “blockchain”.  </p>
                    <p>The video below from simply explained provides a good overview of what blockchain technology is, be sure to watch it!</p>

                    <h3>When?</h3>
                    <p>The origins of blockchain technology dates back to 1991 by two researchers named Stuart Haber and W.Scott Stornetta who shared a common goal of implementing a system where documents are timestamped and cannot be tampered with. However Blockchain technology didn’t gain its notoriety until the launch of Bitcoin in 2009, a digital currency that has amassed a market capitalization of over $1.06T at the time of writing. The introduction of bitcoin provided blockchain technology with its first real-world application.</p>
