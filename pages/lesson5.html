                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>
                        In blockchain technology, there are many different types of blockchains. These blockchains differ in aspects such as architecture and the way they are governed. This lesson will focus on two  specific types of blockchains: Public and private, explaining what they are whilst highlighting the benefits and drawbacks of each approach.

                        <li>To discover what a typical blockchain is made up of.</li>

                    <h3>What are cryptocurrencies?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Cryptocurrencies are cryptographically secured digital representations of value that can be transferred, stored, and traded electronically. In short, a cryptocurrency is a digital currency that can be traded and used to pay for things. Because cryptocurrencies are secured by various cryptographic techniques it makes them nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend.

                    <h3>How do they work?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The difference between cryptocurrencies and digital cash is that they are not controlled centrally, instead they operate on an open network. Transactions are conducted peer to peer without the need of a third party such as a bank. This is possible as they utilize blockchain technology, where a public record is kept of all transactions.
                    </p>

                    <h3>
                        How many cryptocurrencies are there?
                    </h3>

                    

                    <p>
                        As of 2021, there are nearly over 6000 cryptocurrencies. A number likely to increase as new cryptocurrencies are introduced each and every day. The largest cryptocurrency to this date is Bitcoin which was first created in 200W9 by Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin has amassed a market cap of $1.15T and is trading at a value of $60,000 per token at the time of writing.
                        Below you can find a range of cryptocurrencies, each ranked in order by their market cap

                    <h3>
                        Why use cryptocurrencies?
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Cryptocurrencies benefit from most of the advantages that blockchain technology provides. In particular they allow for the transfer of funds directly between two parties without the need for a trusted third party such as a bank or credit card company. Instead, transfers are secured by the use of public and private keys (cryptography). This means that fund transfers are completed with minimal processing fees, allowing the users to avoid the steep fees charged by financial institutions.  Transactions in crypto-currencies are also lighting fast regardless of the distance between the two participants; a user can be sending crypto to someone half way across the world and it will be completed it the same amount of time as if the recipient was in the same domestic country. Due to these properties cryptocurrencies become the optimal solution for transactions. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>What are the risks?</h3>
                    <p>
                        As the privacy and security for cryptocurrencies transactions are high, its hard for the government to track down users. Bitcoin has been used as a vessel to perform illegal activities such as buying drugs or weapons off the black market, or to launder money. 
Also, although cryptocurrencies are very secure, exchanges ( where cryptocurrencies are held to buy from the general public.) are not as secure. This makes them susceptible to malicious attacks from hackers that can steal cryptocurrencies from user accounts. For instance, Bitfinex was an exchange that was subject to a hack that resulted in thousands of bitcoin stolen, that resulted in damages of $760 million.
                    </p>
