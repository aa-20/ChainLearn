                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>
                        In blockchain technology, there are many different types of blockchains. These blockchains differ in aspects such as architecture and the way they are governed. This lesson will focus on two  specific types of blockchains: Public and private, explaining what they are whilst highlighting the benefits and drawbacks of each approach.


                    </p>
                    <h3>Learning outcomes</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To discover what a typical blockchain is made up of.</li>
                        <li>To understand how a blockchain works.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Public blockchain (permissionless)</h3>
                    <p>A public blockchain network is permissionless in the sense that any one can join the network and have access to the ledger (record of transactions). It provides users from all around the world with the ability to interact with the blockchain and submit or read transactions to the network as long as they are connected. There are no restrictions when it comes to participation meaning that anyone can take part in the consensus process ( see previous lesson).</p>
                    <p>Public blockchains bring complete decentralization so there is no central authority responsible for maintaining the blockchain, maintenance is in the hands of the participants of the blockchain network.</p>

                    </div>

                    <p>Examples of public blockchains consists of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin</p>
                    
                    <h3>Private blockchains (permissioned):</h3>
                    <p>
                        Private blockchains, are permissioned blockchains meaning that users are not allowed to freely join the network and read or write to the ledger. These types of blockchains are controlled by a single organization meaning there is a central authority. These central authorities determine who can be a node and participate in the consensus process. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>Advantages and disadvantages of the different types of blockchain</h3>

                    <h3>Public Blockchain (Permissionless)</h3>

                    <p>Benefits:
                        <p>
                            Maximum Security: public blockchains are designed to operate with maximum security. Often , shared networks are victims of online hacking attacks, which is why public blockchains work hard to maintain a high standard of security protocols. An example of this is bitcoin’s proof of work consensus algorithm. Proof of work is so secure that to this day the bitcoin network has never been hacked.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Anonymous nature: with public blockchains, the participants are not required to reveal their real name or identity to participate. Because of this, it is not possible to track down a user’s identity based on their activities on the network.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Transparency:  all participants of a public blockchain can  see each and every transaction at any moment of time because they each have a copy of the ledger. This eliminates the chances of any discrepancies and mitigates the risk of corruption within the network.

                    <p>Drawbacks:
                        <p>
                            Speed: public blockchains like bitcoin are extremely slow, only managing to process seven transactions per second. If we compare this to Visa which can process 24,000 transactions per second, we can see the inefficiency. Public blockchains are slow because it takes time for the network to reach consensus ( ten minutes for proof of work). In this case, the security of public blockchains are traded off for speed.

                        <p>
                            Scalability: Due to the slow processing of transactions, public blockchains face concerns over scalability. As things are now, public blockchains are not able to compete with traditional systems. The slow transaction speed introduces a bottleneck into the network as it scales.

                        <p>
                            Anonymity: The anonymous nature of public blockchains are easily as much as a drawback than it is as a benefit. Due to participants having no fear of their identity being revealed, public b

                    <h3>Private Blockchain (Permissioned)</h3>
                    <p>Benefits:
                        <p>
                            Speed: Opposite to public blockchains, a big advantage of private blockchain is speed. This is because private blockchains have far fewer participants as not everyone can join freely, meaning it takes less time for the network to reach a consensus. In comparison to public blockchains, private blockchains are more efficient in terms of the amount of transactions processed per second. Private blockchains can process thousands of transactions per second whilst public blockchains like bitcoin merely process seven transactions per second.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Scalability: Private blockchains also are much more scalable. This is because only a few nodes are authorized and responsible for managing data, therefore the network can process more transactions making it much more competitive with traditional systems. Due to private blockchains being centralized, the decision making is much faster, therefore the chances of a bottleneck being introduced into the network as it scales is significantly reduced.
                        </p>
                    </p>

                    <p>Drawbacks:
                        <p>
                            Security: As private blockchains contain fewer nodes that public blockchains, it is a lot easier for an untrustworthy individual to gain control of the network. Private blockchains are at a greater risk to hacking and data manipulation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Centralization : Although centralization leads to faster decision making, it is also one of the biggest disadvantages for private blockchains. Blockchain was built to avoid centralization but private blockchains inherently become centralized as the single organization must build and maintain the private network.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Lack of Trust: The trustworthiness of private blockchains depends heavily on the credibility of legitimate nodes. As these nodes are responsible for verifying and validating transactions. In addition private blockchains are not transparent meaning that the validity of records also cannot be independently verified. 
                        </p>
                    </p>



                    <p>Private blockchains are only partially decentralized because public access to these blockchains are restricted. Examples of private blockchains consist of Ripple and Hyperledger.

                    <h3>Conclusion – What is the better choice?</h3>
                    <p>
                        In terms of what type of blockchain is better, it is dependent on the purpose as both types each have their benefits and drawbacks. For instance Public blockchains are better suited for serving large communities due to the transparency which in turn fosters more trust. However it is held back by both speed and scalability.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Private blockchains may be better suited to the corporate world and financial institutions especially if they have an idea of what data will be stored on it. This way it is an advantage to know exactly who has access to what. However as a result trust and security is compromised.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The takeaway is that blockchain technology is consistently improving and bringing  new innovations to the world. So much that there is an option to have a mixture of public and private blockchains where the participants of the network can benefit from the best of both worlds. (Hybrid Blockchain)
