                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>
                        Welcome to the first lesson of foundations of Blockchain. This course aims teach the areas of blockchain to everyone regardless of their background. There will be a variety of sources and videos all maintained one central place as we recognize that people  learn in different ways.  In this lesson you will introduced briefly as to what blockchain is and why it is used.

                    </p>
                    <h3>Learning outcomes</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Get a basic understanding of the concept of blockchain</li>
                        <li>To discover when it was originated.</li>
                        <li>To understand why blockchain technology is used.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>What is blockchain?</h3>
                    <p>To put it simply, a blockchain is a special type of database. A blockchain differs from traditional databases in the way that data is stored. As the name suggests, A blockchain collects information together in groups which can also be referred to as “blocks” and these blocks are linked to other stored blocks that help form a “chain” of data known as a “blockchain”.  </p>
                    <p>The video below from simply explained provides a good overview of what blockchain technology is, be sure to watch it!</p>

                    <h3>When?</h3>
                    <p>The origins of blockchain technology dates back to 1991 by two researchers named Stuart Haber and W.Scott Stornetta who shared a common goal of implementing a system where documents are timestamped and cannot be tampered with. However Blockchain technology didn’t gain its notoriety until the launch of Bitcoin in 2009, a digital currency that has amassed a market capitalization of over $1.06T at the time of writing. The introduction of bitcoin provided blockchain technology with its first real-world application.</p>

                    <h3>Why use blockchain technology?</h3>

                    <p>Blockchain technology possesses multiple features that justify why it should be adopted, for instance:</p>

                    <p><strong>Decentralization:</strong> Blockchains are decentralized, which means that the blockchain is maintained and distributed amongst multiple nodes (computers) without the need of a central authority such as a bank. Therefore, an environment is created where no single person is exclusively in charge. By using blockchain, organizations can bring down the costs that are  associated with using third party vendors.</p>

                    <p><strong>Immutability:</strong>
                        The data that is stored on blockchains is immutable, meaning that once it gets recorded on the blockchain it cannot be changed or deleted.  On a blockchain all of the data is timestamped, and date stamped so there is a permanent record. This enables consumers to utilize blockchain to track information over time, enabling a secure and reliable audit of information. As opposed to using error-prone paper-file based systems or legacy computers which can be corrupted.</p>

                    <p><strong>Security:</strong> Blockchain provides security through the previous two features mentioned. As the data  is immutable and encrypted, blockchain mitigates the risks of fraud and unauthorized activity. Also, since blockchain is decentralized (spread across multiple computers) and not stored on one server, a single point of failure is removed. This in turn provides a greater resistance to malicious attacks from hackers.</p>
