                    <h3>What does a blockchain consist of?</h3>
                    <p>From the previous lesson you know that a blockchain consists of multiple blocks that are linked together. However, what is a block made up of?</p>

                    <figure>
                        <div class="content-image-container">
                            <img class="p-image-test"  src="../images/block-illustration.png" alt="block structure">
                        </div>
                        <figcaption>Make up of a block</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                
                    <p>As shown by illustration above, a block contains the following properties:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Data</li>
                            <li>A hash</li>
                            <li>A hash of the previous block's data.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>

                    <p>These concepts are probably new to the most you but don’t worry they will be explained below:</p>
                    <p><strong>Data:</strong> the type of data depends on what the blockchain is used for. In most cases the data corresponds to transactions, and a single block can contain hundreds of transactions. An example of a transaction is Person A sending £500 to person B.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Hash:</strong> A hash is common concept used in cryptography. It is the value that is returned by a hash function. To put it simply, a hash is a unique combination of letters and numbers. It acts as a digital fingerprint for the data in a block, and is always unique for each block in the blockchain.</p>
                    <p><strong>Hash of previous block: </strong> This property is what makes the blockchain. Each block contains a reference to the previous block’s hash thereby forming a “chain” of data. It is worth noting that by logic the first block will have no previous block so it will reference nothing. This is called the genesis block.</p>
                    <p>Hashes are important as they are one of the main reasons why blockchains are immutable. When a malicious attacker attempts to modify a transaction in a block this causes the hash of that block to change, which in turn causes the hash of the previous block to change, and so on until every block is invalid. This makes attempts of tampering evident to everyone involved in the network. Invalid blocks will never be validated unless the whole blockchain is re-written or participants of network are convinced that falsified data is true. Both instances have been impossible to achieve since blockchain technology was invented.</p>
                    
                    
                    <h3>How does a blockchain work?</h3>

                    <p>Now that we know what a blockchain consists of, lets discuss how it works. This process can be characterized in five steps:
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Step 1 - Transaction:</strong>  two parties agree to exchange a unit of value. This could be a digital currency or some other sort of asset. This in turn initiates the transaction</p>
                    <div class="content-image-container-l2">
                        <img class="p-image"  src="../images/step-1.png" alt="block structure">
                    </div>
                    <p><strong>Step 2 - Block:</strong>  The transaction is bundled together with other pending transactions to form a ‘block’. Then, the block is sent to all of the nodes (computers) participating in the blockchain network.</p>
                    <div class="content-image-container-l2">
                        <img class="p-image"  src="../step-2.png" alt="block structure">
                    </div>
                    <p><strong>Step 3 - Verification:</strong> the participating nodes assess each transaction to determine whether they are valid based on agreed-upon rules. Upon a consensus being reached, the transactions are considered valid. Consensus algorithms are the mechanisms that help derive rules to determine the validity of a transaction, they will be discussed in a later lesson.</p>
                    <div class="content-image-container-l2">
                        <img class="p-image"  src="../images/step-3.png" alt="block structure">
                    </div>
                    <p><strong>Step 4 - The block is added to the existing blockchain:</strong>  After verification the block is added to the existing blockchain in an permanent  way.</p>
                    <div class="content-image-container-l2">
                        <img class="p-image"  src="../images/step-4.png" alt="block structure">
                    </div>
                    <p><strong>Step 5 - Execution: </strong>  the unit of value moves from the account of the first party, to the account of the second party. </p>
                    <div class="content-image-container-l2">
